# Banknote Aunthentication
I am a beginner in the ML world, I tried to make this project as simple 
as possible and only focused on running the K-Means model and calculating 
the result. Thus, to focus on K-Means itself, I only picked 
out two variables to build the models, which are V1 (variance of Wavelet 
Transformed image) and V2 (skewness of Wavelet Transformed image).
